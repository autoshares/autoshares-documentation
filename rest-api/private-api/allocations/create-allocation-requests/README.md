# Create Allocation Requests

### Overview

This PUT endpoint enables you to create and send an allocation request. Allocation requests are used to purchase securities in bulk for multiple users to reduce the exchange commission applied to the order \(the higher the volume — the lower the commission\). Usually, there's a separate trading account on which securities are purchased. Afterward, the purchased securities are transferred to users' trading accounts proportionally to the amount of funds they have contributed.

For example, if one user has contributed 20% of the funds, another user — 30%, and the third — 50%, they will each receive a corresponding number of shares on their trading accounts: the first user will get 20% of the purchased securities, the seconds one will receive 30% of the purchased securities, and the third one will get 50% of the purchased securities. Such securities transfers can be performed with this API request where you specify the trading account on which the securities were purchased, the trading account of the target user, and also the number of securities to be transferred \(along with a few other parameters\).

From a technical standpoint, transference of securities from one account to another during allocation is executed like a regular sale — the source account is selling securities to the target account. You specify the price at which the securities must be transferred, indicate the applicable commission, and at the end of the trading session this transaction is registered with the clearing firm.

Please bear in mind that there are certain regulations that apply to allocations like prohibition of selling securities to users  at a premium. Therefore, please ensure that your allocations comply with the regulator's requirements.

There are four required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. It can be found it in the **BO Companies** widget. When editing the company's settings, navigate to the **WebApi** tab and look for the required key \(it could be a key for the web terminal, the mobile app, or a custom key\).
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request]().
3. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
4. **requestInfo** \(body\). This is a JSON dictionary that contains information about the new allocation.

#### Allocation Request Sample

Each allocation request must be provided in the JSON format in the following way:

```javascript
{
  "FromAccount": "6688",
  "ToAccount": "6687",
  "Symbol": "AAPL",
  "Quantity": 100,
  "Price": 135.89,
  "Commission": 1.36,
  "Action": "Buy",
  "AccountType": "Cash",
  "Comment": "Sample transfer",
  "Instructions": {} //can be omitted
}
```

where:

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| FromAccount | This is the source trading account from which the securities will be transferred. |
| ToAccount | This is the target trading account to which the securities will be transferred from the source trading account. |
| Symbol | This is the ticker symbol of the securities that are to be transferred. |
| Quantity | This is the number of shares that are to be transferred. |
| Price | This is the price at which the securities are to be transferred. |
| Commission | This is the commission that will be charged on the user's trading account for this allocation. You may set this value to 0 if you charge your users monthly for allocations. |
| Action | This is the side of the trade. Possible values: **Buy**, **Sell**. If the value is set to Sell, the securities will be transferred from the users' trading accounts to the joint trading account from which they will be sold on the market. |
| AccountType | This is the type of the account. Possible values: **Cash**, **Margin**, **DayTrader**. |
| Comment | This is the comment for this allocation.  |
| Instructions | These are ancillary instructions for this allocation. You can leave it empty. |

Here's the final template for this API request:

```text
PUT apiURL/v1.0/allocations/simple
```

### Response

In response to this API request, you'll receive a JSON file with the allocation request details along with one extra parameter — **IsSucceed** — which indicates if the allocation has been successfully carried out.

```javascript
{
  "Request": {
    "FromAccount": "6688",
    "ToAccount": "6687",
    "Symbol": "AAPL",
    "Quantity": 100,
    "Price": 135.89,
    "Commission": 1.36,
    "Action": "Buy",
    "AccountType": "Cash",
    "Comment": "Sample transfer",
    "Instructions": {}
  },
  "IsSucceed": true
}
```

### Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when attempting to create allocation requests.

#### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```

#### Specifying User Accounts instead of Trading Accounts

Another common mistake is either specifying user accounts instead of trading accounts when creating an allocation request. Doing so will lead to the 409 status code and the following error message:

```javascript
{
  "Request": {
    "FromAccount": "robert.z",
    "ToAccount": "charlie",
    "Symbol": "AAPL",
    "Quantity": 100,
    "Price": 135.89,
    "Commission": 1.36,
    "Action": "Buy",
    "AccountType": "Cash",
    "Comment": "Sample transfer",
    "Instructions": {}
  },
  "IsSucceed": false,
  "Description": "InvalidAccount"
}
```

As you can notice, the IsSucceed parameter is in this case set to false.
