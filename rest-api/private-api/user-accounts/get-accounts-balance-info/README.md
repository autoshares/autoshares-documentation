### Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when requesting the balance information of a particular trading account:

#### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```

#### Attempting to Use @me to Get the User's Account Balance Information

Even if the user has one trading account, it's not possible to get the balance information of this single account using the @me directive. Attempting to do that will lead to the 400 status code and the following error:

```javascript
{
    "Message": "The request is invalid."
}
```

In the following article we provide in-depth coverage of the syntax for this API request.
