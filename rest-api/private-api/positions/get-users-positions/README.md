# Get User's Positions

### Overview

This GET endpoint enables you to list all existing positions of the user whose authorization token was used in the request's body. 

There are four required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. It can be found it in the **BO Companies** widget. When editing the company's settings, navigate to the **WebApi** tab and look for the required key \(it could be a key for the web terminal, the mobile app, or a custom key\). 
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../../../public-api/authentication/requesting-tokens/).
3. **Trading Account ID** \(path\). This is the numeric ID of the trading account whose positions must be listed. 
4. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".

There's also one optional parameter worth examining:

* filter \(query\). This is an SQL query used to retrieve only those positions that satisfy the conditions of the query. The following table outlines the parameter's syntax.

### Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when attempting to list the existing positions. 

#### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```

#### Specifying the User ID Instead of the Trading Account ID

Another common mistake when making this request is specifying the user ID instead of the user's trading account ID. Doing so will result in the 500 status code and the following error message:

```javascript
{
    "message": "An error occurred while processing your request",
    "error": "Unexpected server error"
}
```

#### Specifying a Trading Account of a Different User

It's critical to understand that when you use the authorization token of a particular user in this request's header, only this user's trading accounts can be used for listing current positions. Placing a new order on a trading account of a different user will lead to the 401 error.

```javascript
{
    "Message": "Authorization has been denied for this request."
}
```
