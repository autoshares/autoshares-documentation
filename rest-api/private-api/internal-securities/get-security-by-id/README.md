# Get Security Info by ID

### Overview

This GET endpoint enables you to retrieve detailed information about a particular security by providing its internal identifier in Autoshares Trader. Unlike the [regular security information method](../../securities/get-securitys-info-by-internal-id/), this method provides a more comprehensive set of information about a particular security. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order to retrieve information about a particular security, you must use an [authorization token](../../authentication/) of an administrator. Using authorization tokens of regular users will lead to the 401 status code.
{% endhint %}

There are four required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. It can be found it in the **BO Companies** widget. When editing the company's settings, navigate to the **WebApi** tab and look for the required key \(it could be a key for the web terminal, the mobile app, or a custom key\).
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../../authentication/).
3. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
4. **securityId** \(path\). This is the internal identifier of a security whose information needs to be retrieved.

Here's the final template for this API request:

```text
GET apiURL/v1.0/internalsecurities/{securityID}
```

### Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when attempting to retrieve information about a particular security.

#### Requesting as a Non-Administrator

One of the most common mistakes that developers make when making this API request is to use the authorization token of a non-administrator. It's critical to understand that in order to be eligible for retrieving information about various securities, the requester must be an administrator. Otherwise you'll receive the 401 status code with the following message:

```javascript
{
    "Message": "Authorization has been denied for this request."
}
```

So be sure to use the authorization token generated with an administrator's credentials.

#### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```

#### Specifying  the Security's Ticker Symbol Instead of its Internal ID

Another common mistake when making this API request is specifying the ticker symbol of the enquired security instead of its internal ID — for this purpose, there's a [separate API request](../get-security-info-by-ticker/). If you specify the security's ticker symbol in this request, you'll receive the 400 status code and the following error message:

```javascript
{
    "Message": "The request is invalid."
}
```

The following article covers the syntax for this API request in detail.
