# Add a New Security

### Overview

This POST endpoint enables you to add a new security to ETNA Trader by sending a JSON file with the updated information. Whereas the public API only permits you to retrieve information about existing securities, the private API also permits addition of new securities. It's critical to be cautious with this procedure because providing incorrect information might lead to certain conflicts like the absence of quotes for a particular security.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order to add a new security, you must use an [authorization token](../../authentication/) of an administrator. Using authorization tokens of regular users will lead to the 401 status code.
{% endhint %}

There are four required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. It can be found it in the **BO Companies** widget. When editing the company's settings, navigate to the **WebApi** tab and look for the required key \(it could be a key for the web terminal, the mobile app, or a custom key\).
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../../authentication/).
3. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
4. **newSecurity** \(body\). This is a JSON file with the security's parameters that must be updated.

### Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when attempting to create a new security.

#### Requesting as a Non-Administrator

One of the most common mistakes that developers make when making this API request is to use the authorization token of a non-administrator. It's critical to understand that in order to be eligible for creating new securities, the requester must be an administrator. Otherwise you'll receive the 401 status code with the following message:

```javascript
{
    "Message": "Authorization has been denied for this request."
}
```

So be sure to use the authorization token generated with an administrator's credentials.

#### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```

#### Failing to Provide All Required Parameters

Another common mistake when making this API request is failing to provide all required parameters in the request's body. In the first table of this page we have outlined all required parameters for this request, so ensure that you provide all of them; otherwise you'll receive the 500 status code and the following error message:

```javascript
{
  "message": "An error occurred while processing your request",
  "error": "Unexpected server error"
}
```

The following article covers the syntax for this API request in detail.
