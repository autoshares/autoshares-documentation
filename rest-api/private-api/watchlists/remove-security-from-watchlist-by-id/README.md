# Remove Security from Watchlist by ID

### Overview

This DELETE endpoint enables you to remove a particular security from a particular watchlist by providing the security's ID in the request's path. 

There are six required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. It can be found it in the **BO Companies** widget. When editing the company's settings, navigate to the **WebApi** tab and look for the required key \(it could be a key for the web terminal, the mobile app, or a custom key\).
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../../authentication/).
3. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
4. **watchlistID** \(path\). This is the ID of the watchlist from which a security must be removed.
5. **userID** \(path\). This is the ID of the user whose particular watchlist should have the specified security removed.
6. **securityID** \(path\). This is the ID of the security that must be removed from a particular watchlist. You can fetch the ID of a particular security with [this method](../../securities/get-securitys-info-by-its-ticket-symbol/).

The final template for this request is as follows:

```text
DELETE apiURL/v1.0/users/{userID}/watchlists/{watchlistID}/securities/{securityID}
```

### Response

In response to this API request, you'll receive the updated watchlist with the specified security removed. In this example we've removed the Apple stock from a tech-oriented watchlist.

### Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when attempting to remove a particular security from a watchlist.

#### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```

#### Specifying  the Security's Ticker Symbol Instead of its Internal ID

Another common mistake when making this API request is specifying the ticker symbol of the to-be-added security instead of its internal ID â€” for this purpose, there's a [separate API request](../remove-security-from-watchlist-by-ticker/). If you specify the security's ticker symbol in this request, you'll receive the 400 status code and the following error message:

```javascript
{
    "Message": "The request is invalid."
}
```

The following article covers the syntax for this API request in detail.
