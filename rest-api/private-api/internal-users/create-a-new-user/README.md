# Create a New User

### Overview

This POST endpoint enables you to create a new user in Autoshares Trader. Information about the new user is provided in the request body as a JSON, and the new user is then automatically added to your company. 

There are five required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. It can be found it in the **BO Companies** widget. When editing the company's settings, navigate to the **WebApi** tab and look for the required key \(it could be a key for the web terminal, the mobile app, or a custom key\).
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../../authentication/).
3. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
4. **sendInvitationEmail** \(query\). This is a boolean parameter that indicates if the newly created user should receive an invitation email.
5. **user** \(body\). This a JSON file that contains information about the to-be-created user.

### Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when attempting to create a new user.

#### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
