### Overview

This GET endpoint enables you to retrieve the address of the user whose ID is provided in the request's path.

There are four required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. It can be found it in the **BO Companies** widget. When editing the company's settings, navigate to the **WebApi** tab and look for the required key \(it could be a key for the web terminal, the mobile app, or a custom key\).
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request]().
3. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
