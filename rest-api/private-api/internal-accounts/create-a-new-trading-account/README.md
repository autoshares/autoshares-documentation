# Create a New Trading Account

### Overview

This POST endpoint enables you to create a new trading account. After the trading account is created, it should be bound to a user, and afterward it can be used for trading \(if the clearing firm approves the new trading account\).

There are four required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. It can be found it in the **BO Companies** widget. When editing the company's settings, navigate to the **WebApi** tab and look for the required key \(it could be a key for the web terminal, the mobile app, or a custom key\).
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../../authentication/).
3. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
4. **accountModel** \(body\). This is a JSON file with the information about the new created trading account.
