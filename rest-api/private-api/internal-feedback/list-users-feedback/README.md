# List Users' Feedback

### Overview

This GET endpoint enables you to list user feedback across the entire company. This feedback is split into numerous pages, and you can retrieve each page with a separate API call. Unlike the regular user feedback listing functionality that fetches feedback for a particular user, this method retrieves the entirety of feedback provided by all users.

There are seven required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. It can be found it in the **BO Companies** widget. When editing the company's settings, navigate to the **WebApi** tab and look for the required key \(it could be a key for the web terminal, the mobile app, or a custom key\).
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../../authentication/).
3. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
4. **pageSize** \(query\). This field indicates the number of user feedbacks that need to be retrieved per page.
5. **pageNumber** \(query\). This field indicates the number of the page that need to be retrieved \(all user feedbacks are split into a set of pages that can be loaded one by one\).
6. **sortBy** \(query\). This is the field by which the retrieved user feedbacks should be sorted. For example, if the value of this parameter is set to **Contacts**, the retrieved feedbacks will be sorted by the users' contact information.
7. **isDesc** \(query\). This field indicates if the list of retrieved feedbacks should be sorted in the descending \(true\) or ascending \(false\) order.

There's also one optional parameter worth examining:

* filter \(request query\). This is an SQL query used to retrieve only those feedbacks that satisfy the conditions of the query. 

#### Filter Syntax

The syntax for filter queries is rather simple: each parameter of a feedback can serve as a filter. The conditions that a parameter needs to satisfy can be expressed in the following ways:

1. **Parameter** \(=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=\) **value**. For example: `Timestamp = 0`
2. **Parameter** \(=, contains, startsWith, endsWith\) **string**. For example: `UserAgent contains 'Mozilla'`
3. **Parameter** in \(**value1**, **value2**, etc.\). In this case the parameter has to be contained in the set of values in the parentheses to satisfy the filter condition. For example: `Id in (7420, 7630, 9870)`
4. **Parameter** between **Value1** and **Value2**. In this case the parameter has to be in the specified range between Value1 and Value2 to satisfy the filter condition. For example: `Timestamp between 1552398906 and 1553590520`.

Boolean values are provided in the following format: `true` and `false`.

Numeric values are provided in the regular format: `2500`.

Strings must be highlighted with quotation marks: `'USD'`.

Dates must be highlighted with with the pound sign: `#2019-08-09T18:31:42#`.

The following table lists a set of sample queries:

where:

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Result | This is an array that contains the retrieved feedbacks \(the number of elements in the array depends on the value set in the **pageSize** parameter\). |
| Id | This is the internal identifier of the feedback in Autoshares Trader. |
| Contacts | This is the users' contact information. |
| Subject | This is the subject line of a user feedback. |
| Comment | This is the body of a user feedback. |
| Login | This is the login of the user who's submitted the feedback. |
| UserAgent | This is the platform used by the user when they submitted the feedback. |
| TimeStamp | This is the time \(in C\# ticks\) when the feedback was submitted. |
| BuildVersion | This is the version of Autoshares Trader that the user was using when they submitted the feedback. |
| Files | This is an array with the files the user attached when submitting the feedback. |
| NextPageLink | This is the next page of the user feedback. |
| PreviousPageLink | This is the previous page of the user feedback. |
| TotalCount | This is the total number of user feedbacks. |

### Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when attempting to list all users' feedback.

#### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```

#### Failing to Specify the Query Parameters

It's crucial to understand that the _**pageSize, pageNumber, isDesc, and sortBy**_ parameters must be provided in the request; otherwise you'll receive the 404 status code and the following message:

```javascript
{
    "Error": {
        "Code": "UnsupportedApiVersion",
        "Message": "The requested resource with API version '1.0' does not support HTTP method 'GET'."
    }
}
```
