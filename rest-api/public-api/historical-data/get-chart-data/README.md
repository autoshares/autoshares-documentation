# Get Chart Data

### Overview

This PUT endpoint enables you to retrieve and compare historical trading data for a set of securities. This data includes price ranges, candles, and various other non-market data. 

There are four required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. Contact your administrator to get this key.
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../../authentication/requesting-tokens/).
3. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
4. **model** \(body\). This is a JSON dictionary that contains information about the enquired securities.

#### Enquired Securities Syntax

Here's an example of the request body with the information about the enquired securities.

```javascript
{"Securities":
	[{"Symbol":"MSFT","Exchange":"XNAS","Currency":"USD","Id":6},
	{"Symbol":"AAPL","Exchange":"XNAS","Currency":"USD","Id":4}],
	
	"SecuritiesHistorySettings":
	{
		"StartDate":1548046800,
		"EndDate":1550755974,
		"CandlesCount":10,
		"Period":"1h",
		"Interval":1,
		"IncludeNonMarketData":false
	}
}
```

where:

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Securities | This is an array with the enquired securities. |
| Symbol | This is the ticker symbol of the security under which it is listed on the exchange. |
| Exchange | This is the exchange on which the enquired security is listed. |
| Currency | This is the currency in which the enquired security is denominated. |
| StartDate | This is the beginning of the period for which the data will be retrieved. |
| EndDate | This is the end of the period for which the data will be retrieved. |
| CandlesCount | This is the number of candles that will be retrieved for the specified time period. |
| Interval | This is the trading data interval for the specified time period.  |

{% hint style="warning" %}
All parameters must be provided in the body JSON; otherwise the chart data will not be retrieved.
{% endhint %}

Here's the final template for this API request:

```text
PUT apiURL/v1.0/history/compare

### Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when attempting to retrieve trading data for a set of securities.

#### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```

#### Incorrectly Specifying the Request Body 

Another common mistake when attempting to retrieve the chart data for a set of securities is incorrectly structuring the request body. It's critical that you follow the template provided above and specify all of the required parameters. Otherwise you'll receive the 500 status code and the following error message: 

```javascript
{
    "message": "An error occurred while processing your request",
    "error": "Unexpected server error"
}
```

The following article covers the syntax for this API request in detail.
