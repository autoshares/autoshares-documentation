# Place Order

### Overview

This POST endpoint enables you to place a new order in Autoshares Trader. The order is sent in the JSON format to our service which turns it into a new outstanding order that should eventually be fulfilled \(or suspended depending on the type of order and the [order review mechanisms](../../../../administrator-guide/administrators-widgets/bo-order-review/) applicable to this user\). 

There are five required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. Contact your administrator to get this key.
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../../authentication/requesting-tokens/).
3. **Trading Account ID** \(path\). This is the numeric ID of the trading account on which a new order must be placed. 
4. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
5. **body** \(body of the request\). This is a JSON file that contains the order's characteristics. 

Here's the final template for this API request:

```text
POST apiURL/v1.0/accounts/{accountID}/orders
```

### Request Body

#### One-Triggers-the-Other Order Type

One-Triggers-the-Other is a type of conditional order in which execution of one order automatically triggers the other one. Each of the two orders has to be provided as a separate leg:

```javascript
{
	"Type": "OneTriggerOther", //the type of the order
        "Symbol": "AAPL",
		"Legs": [{ //the array of two legs
			"Symbol": "AAPL", //the first leg
			"Type": "Limit",
			"Price": 150,
			"Side": "Buy",
			"Quantity": 100
		},
		{
			"Symbol": "TSLA", //the second leg
			"Type": "Limit",
			"Price": 100,
			"Side": "Buy",
			"Quantity": 100
		}
	]
}
```

In this case, if the limit order to purchase the Apple stock gets executed, the second limit order to purchase the Tesla stock will automatically be triggered.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In One-Triggers-the-Other orders, the first leg cannot be a market order.
{% endhint %}

#### One-Cancels-the-Other Order Type

One-Cancels-the-Other is a type of conditional order in which execution of one order automatically cancels the other one. Each of the two orders has to be provided as a separate leg:

```javascript
{
	"Type": "OneCancelOther", //the type of the order
        "Symbol": "AAPL",
		"Legs": [{ //the array of two legs
			"Symbol": "AAPL", //the first leg
			"Type": "Limit",
			"Price": 150,
			"Side": "Buy",
			"Quantity": 100
		},
		{
			"Symbol": "TSLA", //the second leg
			"Type": "Limit",
			"Price": 100,
			"Side": "Buy",
			"Quantity": 100
		}
	]
}
```

In this case, if the limit order to purchase the Apple stock gets executed, the second limit order to purchase the Tesla stock will automatically be cancelled.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In One-Cancels-the-Other orders, both legs cannot be market orders.
{% endhint %}

}
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that you may receive the 200 status code even if the order was improperly configured. For example, if you attempt to create a limit order and specify the stop price instead of the limit price, the order will be registered in the system but will eventually be rejected. Please monitor the order's status \(it's _PendingNew_ by default\) to determine if the order has been rejected or placed.
{% endhint %}

### Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when attempting to place a new order. 

#### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```

#### Specifying the User ID Instead of the Trading Account ID

Another common mistake when making this request is specifying the user ID instead of the user's trading account ID. Doing so will result in the 500 status code and the following error message:

```javascript
{
    "message": "An error occurred while processing your request",
    "error": "Unexpected server error"
}
```

#### Specifying a Trading Account of a Different User

It's critical to understand that when you use the authorization token of a particular user in this request's header, only this user's trading accounts can be used for placing new orders. Placing a new order on a trading account of a different user will lead to the 401 error.

```javascript
{
    "Message": "Authorization has been denied for this request."
}
```

In the following article we provide in-depth coverage of the syntax for this API request.
