# Get User's Positions in a Security

### Overview

This GET endpoint enables you to list all positions in a particular security of the user whose authorization token was used in the request's body. 

There are five required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. Contact your administrator to get this key.
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../../authentication/requesting-tokens/).
3. **Trading Account ID** \(path\). This is the numeric ID of the trading account whose positions in a particular security must be listed. 
4. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
5. **Ticker Symbol** \(path\). This is the ticker symbol of the security whose positions you'd like to list. 

Here's the final template for this API request:

```text
GET apiURL/v1.0/accounts/{accountID}/positions/AAPL
```

### Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when attempting to list a user's positions in a particular security. 

#### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```

#### Specifying the User ID Instead of the Trading Account ID

Another common mistake when making this request is specifying the user ID instead of the user's trading account ID. Doing so will result in the 500 status code and the following error message:

```javascript
{
    "message": "An error occurred while processing your request",
    "error": "Unexpected server error"
}
```

#### Specifying the Internal ID of the Security instead of the Ticker

Bear in mind that this request requires the ticker symbol of the security \(as displayed on the exchange\) and not the internal ID in Autoshares Trader. Specifying the internal ID will lead to the 500 status code and the following error message:

```javascript
{
    "message": "An error occurred while processing your request",
    "error": "Unexpected server error"
}
```

The following article demonstrates the syntax for this API request in detail.
