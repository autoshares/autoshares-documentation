# Get User's Price Alerts

## Overview

This GET endpoint enables you to retrieve the list of a user's price alerts. Price alerts are essentially notifications that are sent to the user when the alert's conditions are satisfied by the market. For example, a user may have a price alert that will notify them when the price of the Apple stock exceeds $200.

There are eight required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. Contact your administrator to get this key.
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../../authentication/requesting-tokens/).
3. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
4. **userID** \(path\). This is the ID of the user whose particular watchlist needs to be have one security removed.
5. **pageSize** \(query\). This field indicates the number of price alerts that needs to be retrieved per page.
6. **pageNumber** \(query\). This field indicates the number of the page that needs to be retrieved \(all price alerts are split into a set of pages that can be loaded one by one\).
7. **sortBy** \(query\). This is the field by which the retrieved alerts should be sorted. For example, if you the value of this parameter is set to **State**, the retrieved alerts will be sorted by their state.
8. **isDesc** \(query\). This field indicates if the list of retrieved price alerts should be sorted in the descending \(true\) or ascending \(false\) order.

Here's the final template for this API request:

```text
GET apiURL/v1.0/users/@me/pricealerts?pageSize=10&pageNumber=0&sortBy=State&isDesc=true
```

## Response

In response to this API request, you'll receive a JSON file with the list of the user's price alerts.

```javascript

## Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when attempting to retrieve the list of a user's price alerts.

### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```

### Failing to Specify the Query Parameters

It's crucial to understand that the _**pageSize, pageNumber, isDesc, and sortBy**_ parameters must be provided in the request; otherwise you'll receive the 404 status code and the following message:

```javascript
{
    "Error": {
        "Code": "UnsupportedApiVersion",
        "Message": "The requested resource with API version '1.0' does not support HTTP method 'GET'."
    }
}
```
