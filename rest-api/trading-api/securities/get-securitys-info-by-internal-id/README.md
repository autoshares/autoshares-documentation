# Get Equity Info by Internal ID

## Overview

This GET endpoint enables you to retrieve information about a particular security by specifying its internal ID in the request's path. This information is not retrieved directly from the exchange; rather, it's the information about the security that is specific to ETNA Trader.

There are four required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. Contact your administrator to get this key.
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../../authentication/requesting-tokens/).
3. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
4. **ID** \(path\). This is the internal ID of the security whose information you'd like to retrieve. 

Here's the final template for this API request:

```text
GET apiURL/v1.0/equities/4 //Apple Inc.
```

## Response

    "Symbol": "AAPL",
    "Description": "Apple Inc.",
    "Exchange": "XNAS",
    "Currency": "USD",
    "AddedDate": "2012-11-29T16:05:43.993Z",
    "ModifyDate": "2018-12-10T08:00:22.2867686Z",

    "TickSize": 0.01,
    "Enabled": true,
